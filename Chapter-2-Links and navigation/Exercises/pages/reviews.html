            <p>"A Thrilling ride from start to finish, 2012 delivers on its promise of epic disaster and heart-pounding action."</p>

            <p>"A visually stunning spectacle that keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, the plot may feel overly familiar to disaster movie aficionados."</p>

            <p>"I had a lot of fun taking my 12 year old son and two of his friends to this movie. 
                2012 was no more far-fetched than; e.g., Independence Day, The Abyss, Armageddon, The Core.... 
                I could go on and on. Further, the "Gremlins"-like touches of humor made 2012 go down much easier than the afore-mentioned films, which mildly insult by pretending to be plausible science fiction. 
                I get annoyed reading the showy displays of "brilliance" by reviewers who point out that the events are ludicrous, melodramatic, over-the-top, etc. OF COURSE THEY ARE. So was King Kong in 1933. 
                Such critics remind me of sullen adolescents who've just learned the moon isn't really made of green cheese. I recommend they have young children and take them to a Saturday matin√©e featuring a Jane Austen flick. 
                I'm sure it'll be a swell time for all."</p>

            <p>"The scale isn't just a 1 or 10. Yes this film wasn't a 10, but for the production value alone, plus the decent s/vfx and all star cast, no way anyone besides a wannabe critic could give this film anything less than a 6. 
                Sure it had its flaws, but it was still epic. Great casting, cinematography, directing and conceptual story of a modern day Noah's Arc. 
               It's a well deserved 8/10 from me. Click on my username to see more of my 900+ reviews and read my profile to learn how to properly review a film and give credit to where credit is deserved."</p>
